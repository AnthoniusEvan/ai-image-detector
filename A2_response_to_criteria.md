Overview
------------------------------------------------

- **Name:** Anthonius Evan
- **Student number:** n12342734
- **Partner name (if applicable):** Alexander Steven - n11671025@qut.edu.au
- **Application name:** AI Image Detector
- **Two line description:** This app detects if an image is real or AI-generated. Users can then see the website's prediction as well as the confidence level for the prediction.
- **EC2 instance name or ID:** i-06a8765dc92716a31

------------------------------------------------

### Core - First data persistence service

- **AWS service name:**  S3
- **What data is being stored?:** Image files uploaded by users
- **Why is this service suited to this data?:** [eg. large files are best suited to blob storage due to size restrictions on other services]
- **Why is are the other services used not suitable for this data?:**
- **Bucket/instance/table name:**
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### Core - Second data persistence service

- **AWS service name:**  DynamoDB
- **What data is being stored?:** Users account and image metadata 
- **Why is this service suited to this data?:**
- **Why is are the other services used not suitable for this data?:**
- **Bucket/instance/table name:**
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### Third data service

- **AWS service name:** 
- **What data is being stored?:** 
- **Why is this service suited to this data?:** 
- **Why is are the other services used not suitable for this data?:**
- **Bucket/instance/table name:**
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### S3 Pre-signed URLs

- **S3 Bucket names:** ai-detector-image-uploads
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    - aws_related/s3.py

### In-memory cache

- **ElastiCache instance name:** ai-image-detector-memcache
- **What data is being cached?:** The results obtained from the prediction
- **Why is this data likely to be accessed frequently?:** There might be some controversial images that is hard to distinguish between real or AI, and the same images are being uploaded by multiple users
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    - aws_related/memcached.py

### Core - Statelessness

- **What data is stored within your application that is not stored in cloud data services?:** The app doesnâ€™t store any data locally. It only keeps short-lived variables while handling a request, which are cleared once the request finishes.
- **Why is this data not considered persistent state?:** These values are temporary and not saved anywhere. All important data (like users, images, and cache) is stored in cloud services such as Cognito, S3, DynamoDB and ElastiCache.
- **How does your application ensure data consistency if the app suddenly stops?:** The app is stateless. If it stops or restarts, it just reconnects to the cloud services and continues working normally. No data is lost because everything is stored outside the app.
- **Relevant files:**
    - main.py
    - aws/cognito/*
    - aws_related/dynamo.py
    - aws_related/s3.py
    - aws_related/memcached.py

### Graceful handling of persistent connections

- **Type of persistent connection and use:** [eg. server-side-events for progress reporting]
- **Method for handling lost connections:** [eg. client responds to lost connection by reconnecting and indicating loss of connection to user until connection is re-established ]
- **Relevant files:**
    -


### Core - Authentication with Cognito

- **User pool name:** ai-image-detector-user-pool
- **How are authentication tokens handled by the client?:** Response to login request sets a value in the session middleware containing the user info token.
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    - app/main.py -> authorize()

### Cognito multi-factor authentication

- **What factors are used for authentication:** Email verification code
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    - aws/cognito/signUp.py

### Cognito federated identities

- **Identity providers used:** Google
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    - 

### Cognito groups

- **How are groups used to set permissions?:** 'Admin' users can view uploaded images
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    - app/main.py -> is_user_admin(user)

### Core - DNS with Route53

- **Subdomain**:  [ai-image-detector.cab432.com](https://ai-image-detector.cab432.com/)
- **Video timestamp:**

### Parameter store

- **Parameter names:** [eg. n1234567/base_url]
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -

### Secrets manager

- **Secrets names:** [eg. n1234567-youtube-api-key]
- **Video timestamp:**
- **Relevant files:**
    -
